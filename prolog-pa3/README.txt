Understanding the Natural Language Parsing of Prolog and getting it to work with the grammar of the assignment was insanely difficult to implement and get to a functional level.

Feedback: Part 1 works fully with all the rules that needed to be written created in our prolog file for part 1. It passes the example test cases and can infer based on the rules.

Part 2 is not working as we had a lot of difficulty understanding defining the DCGs (Definite Clause Grammars)

Notes:

	Part 1: 
		defined the new relations in relations.pl that 
		defines take care of all the different new rules that needed
		to be written for this part using the relationships of StudentOf and TeacherOf. After that wrote part1Tester.pl to 		test the example queries given to ensure the inferencing works.
	

	Part 2:
		DCG
